# What happened after the All-Star break?

This repo contains all the necessary files for maintaining [this dashboard](https://all-star-break-dash.herokuapp.com/) which looks at the performance of 3 different MLB pitchers before and after the All-Star break. The dashboard is built using Python-based [Dash](https://plot.ly/dash/) by Plotly.

## Installation

The dashboard is deployed using [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps), so installation is not necessary.

## Usage

Use [this link](https://all-star-break-dash.herokuapp.com/) to access the dashboard. You can use the dropdowns to explore the data for each pitcher.

## Support & Contributing
For help or if you want to build additional Dash components, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Pull requests are welcome. Please make sure to include tests as appropriate.
